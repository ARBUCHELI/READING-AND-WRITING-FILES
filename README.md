# READING-AND-WRITING-FILES

<strong>Flying Circus Cast List</strong>

You're going to create a list of the actors who appeared in the television programme Monty Python's Flying Circus.

Write a function called <strong>create_cast_list</strong> that takes a filename as input and returns a list of actors' names. It will be 
run on the file <strong>flying_circus_cast.txt</strong> (this information was collected from imdb.com). Each line of that file consists of an actor's name, a comma, and 
then some (messy) information about roles they played in the programme. You'll need to extract only the name and add it to a list. You
might use the <strong>.split()</strong> method to process each line.
